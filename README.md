# OpenOrganizer
## An automated open source storeage system for small mechanical and electronic parts

The goals of this project are as follows:
* OpenSource
* Easy and cheap to build
* Reliable
* Scalable
* Easy to use UI to manage the contents of the storeage

A working prototype was already built. To see it in action visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_ZOjyPq00. This prototype is not reliable enough which is why there will be a next verison in which the Containers are stacked vertically instead of horizontally.
